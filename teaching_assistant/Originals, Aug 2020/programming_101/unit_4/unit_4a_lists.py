list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(list1)

# list positions are called indices

print(type(list1))
print(bool(list1))
print(list1[-2])

# starts at 0, total length is the lenght of list minus 1
# but can print -1, that'll always be the last value
# VERY convenient, because it'll always let you reference the LAST item quicxly
# A LIST CAN HAVE ANY DATATYPE, INCLUDING OTHER LISTS!

# list methods
# list_name.append(3) # adds to very end
# list_name.insert(index_number, item) adds at that index, MOVING EVERYTHING OVER RIGHT


# Remove from a list
# del list_name[index] will delete

# sort()
# animals.sort() # will sort lists alphabetically and numbers ascending

# animals.reverse() reverses the list!

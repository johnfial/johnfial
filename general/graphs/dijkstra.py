# How to implement the above algorithm?
# Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE ” first, before moving on to the solution. 
 

# We use a boolean array sptSet[] to represent the set of vertices included in SPT. If a value sptSet[v] is true, then vertex v is included in SPT, otherwise not. Array dist[] is used to store the shortest distance values of all vertices.

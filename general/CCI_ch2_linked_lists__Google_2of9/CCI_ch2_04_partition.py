# Partition:
# Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. 
# (IMPORTANT: The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition", it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
# The additional spacing in the example below indicates the partition. 
# Yes, the output below is one of many valid outputs!)

# EXAMPLE:

# input 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1        [partition = 5]
# output: 3 -> 1 -> 2    ->         10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

# Hints: 3, 24

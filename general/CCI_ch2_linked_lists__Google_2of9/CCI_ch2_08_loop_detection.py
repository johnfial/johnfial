# Title

# TODO 1 two runner technique... make two incrementing runners
# TODO 2 while runner.next != None increment...
# if one = None, return False
# NOTE # Q: which node is NOT part of the loop but its node.next IS part of the loop but? That's the first one.
# 



# Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the 
# node at the beginning of the loop.
# Definition: Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a 
# node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the 
# linked list.

# EXAMPLE:
# Input: A ~~> B ~~> C ~~> D ~~> E ~~> C 
# Output: C

# 1.5 One Away 
# There are three types of edits that can be performed on string: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings,
# write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
# EXAMPLE:
#     pale, ple   --> True
#     pales, pale --> True
#     pale, bale  --> True
#     pale, bake  --> False

# Hints: 23, 97, 130

# seems harder...
# first. check for each letter in counter i, increment: different_indices = 0, by +1 for each different...
# have a temp new string to compare...

# finally, return true or false if unmber edits is close...

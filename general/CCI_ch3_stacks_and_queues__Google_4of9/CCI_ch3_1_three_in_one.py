# 3.1 Three in One:
# Describe how you would use a single array to implement three stacks.
# Hints: 2, 12, 38, 58





# 3.3 Stack of Plates:
# (copied rather than transcribed, cheating!)
# # Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
# Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some
# threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetO-fStacks should be
# composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.
# SetOfStacks. push() and SetOfStacks. pop() should behave identically to a single stack
# (that is, pop () should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
# FOLLOW UP
# Implement a function popAt ( int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
# Hints:#64, #87
# pg233
# Hints: 64, 81


# 3.4 Queue vs. Stack
# Implement a MyQueue class which implements a Queue using two stacks.
# Hints: 98, 118




# 3.5 Sort Stack:
# Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use an additional
# temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (like an array). The stack supports the 
# following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.
# Hints: 15, 32, 43



# 3.6 Animal Shelter:

# Hints: 22, 56, 56

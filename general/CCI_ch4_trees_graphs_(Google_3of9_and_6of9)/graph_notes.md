Common to graphs and trees:
    - edges
        - edges can be directed (one-way) with origin/destination, annotated (u, v) where () is ordered
        - undirected (two way), annotated {u, v} where {} is un-ordered

Standard equation: G + (V, E) # where G Graph and V vertices(aka nodes) and E edges

# # # # # # 
#### One way to think about a graph might be as a dictionary of lists as values. Say a frind network -- the user as the key, their own friends as a list in values. ..

... But this is different from creating the data structure yourself!

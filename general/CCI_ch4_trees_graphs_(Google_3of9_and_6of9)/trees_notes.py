# ASK: Is it a balanced or imbalanced tree? Usually balanced.

# TERMS:
# main top parent: root
    # childron: nodes
    # nodes wmith no children = "leaf" node

# methods: 
# BREADTH first traversal:
    # BREADTH first traversal goes through each level, so level 0 (root), then
    # level 2, one level down, etc...
# DEPTH first traversal:
    # goes through an entire node/children before moving on

# # # # # # # # # # # # 
# BINARY trees may only have 2 children per node
# In a binary tree, left nodes are  smaller than right 

# # # # # # # # # # # # 
# TREE TRAVERSALS:


# # # # # # # # # # # # 
# a TRIE is a kind of tree that stores value for each node based on position in the trie (commonly used for strings)

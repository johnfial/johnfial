# 6.2 Basketball
# You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
# Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
# Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.

# If y is the probability of making a particular shit, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other.
# Hints: 181, 239, 284, 323

# So just brainstorming it, there's obviously a threshold where you should always play the one-shot game. 
# My feeling is the higher probability, the more likely you should play the two-shot game. But that could be wrong. 
# For a 99% probable shot, it's best to do 2/3, right? You have a 1% chance to miss once, but less than 1% chance to miss 2/3 or 3/3 shots in the 2nd game style.

# But my probability testing broke down... Doing examples with coins... yeah: boo.

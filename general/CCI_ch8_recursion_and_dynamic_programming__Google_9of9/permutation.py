# Write a recursive function for generating all permutations of an input string. Return them as a set.

# Don't worry about time or space complexity—if we wanted efficiency we'd write an iterative version.

# To start, assume every character in the input string is unique.

# Your function can have loops—it just needs to also be recursive.

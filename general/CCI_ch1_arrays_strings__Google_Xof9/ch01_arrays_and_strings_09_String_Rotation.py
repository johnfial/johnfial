# # 1.9 String Rotation
# # Assume you have a method .isSubstring() which checks if one word is a substring of another. 
# Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call 
# to isSubstring (e.g. 'waterbottle' is a rotation of 'erbottlewat').

# # # Hints: 34, 88, 104

def is_rotated(s1, s2):
    if s1 == s2:
        return True

ex1a = 'aoeu'
ex1b = 'aoeu'

print(is_rotated(ex1a, ex1b))

# Array Notes

### In Python as a dynamic array, also called a list
#### Still to understand:
- Do all dynamic arrays allow all data types, like Python's?

"Array-based data structures" and "Critical Ideas to think" below from https://www.enjoyalgorithms.com/blog/introduction-to-arrays :

<h3><strong>Array-based data structures</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Array implementation of stack</li>
<li>Array implementation of queue</li>
<li>Array implementation of double-ended queue</li>
<li>Array implementation of binary heap</li>
<li>Array implementation of priority queue</li>
<li>Array implementation of Hash tables (open addressing method)</li>
<li>Graph implementation using the adjacency matrix</li>
</ul>


<h3><strong>Critical ideas to think!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Which Indexing is more effcient: 0-based indexing or 1-based indexing?</li>
<li>How does a dynamic array solve fixed array size problems?</li>
<li>What type of data structure do we use to store multiple types of items in a continuous memory location?</li>
<li>How can we find the length of an array, given only the name of the array?</li>
<li>What is the use/application of 3D arrays?</li>
<li>How can we insert or delete a new element at the beginning of an unsorted or sorted array?</li>

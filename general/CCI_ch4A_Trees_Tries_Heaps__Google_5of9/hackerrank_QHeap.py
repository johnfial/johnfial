# This question is designed to help you get a better understanding of basic heap operations.

# There are

# types of query:

#     "

# " - Add an element
# to the heap.
# "
# " - Delete the element
# from the heap.
# "

#     " - Print the minimum of all the elements in the heap.

# NOTE: It is guaranteed that the element to be deleted will be there in the heap. Also, at any instant, only distinct elements will be in the heap.

# Input Format

# The first line contains the number of queries,
# .
# Each of the next lines contains one of the

# types of query.

# Constraints

# Output Format

# For each query of type

# , print the minimum value on a single line.

# Sample Input

# STDIN       Function
# -----       --------
# 5           Q = 5
# 1 4         insert 4
# 1 9         insert 9
# 3           print minimum
# 2 4         delete 4
# 3           print minimum

# Sample Output

# 4  
# 9 

# Explanation

# After the first
# queries, the heap contains {}. Printing the minimum gives as the output. Then, the query deletes from the heap, and the query gives as the output.

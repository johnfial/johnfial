# Heaps
    - A heap is a subset of a (binary) tree, itself (as all trees are) a subset of a graph
    - A Heap is a subset of binary trees, with extra rules:
        1. Complete: all nodes must be in a specific order, all levels filled, either filled or full l-to-right, and only the rightmost nodes on the last level empty
        2. its shape must be complete -- i.e.: 
    - Min heap or max heap
        - minimum is always root, each parent is < child
        - max heap: max is always root, each parent is > child

# QUESTION: When finished with writing one line of code, especially if there remains a quote/apostrophe/parenthesis/etc., I want to rapidly be able to start writing the next line. 
# But my right hand must move to either 'enter,' which sometimes isn't acceptable because it'll break the current line in two, or End+Enter or RightArrow+Enter. Is there a good way to skip to the next line without moving my right hand? ...Save remapping my own shortcut key to a function key, like F3?

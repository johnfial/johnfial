#  Example:

# input:  route = [ [0,   2, 10],
#                   [3,   5,  0],
#                   [9,  20,  6],

#                   [10, 10,  8] ]

# output: 5 # less than 5 kWh and the drone would crash before the finish
#           # line. More than `5` kWh and itâ€™d end up with excess energy

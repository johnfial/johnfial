# 10.4 You are given an array-like data structure *Listy* which lacks a size method. It does, however
# have an elementAt(1) method that returns the element at index 1 in O(1) time. 
# If it is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it returns -1. 
# (For this reason, the data structure only supports positive integers.) 
# Given a Listy which contains sorted, positive integers, 
# find the index at which an element x occurs. If x occurs multiple times, you may return any index.

# Hints: 320, 337, 348

# TODO STATUS:    Done, but replacing trailing spaces and not sure -- based on example -- that's what they want, but the instructions don't make that clear
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 

# 1.3
# URLify
# Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the 
# end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in
# Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
    # EXAMPLE:
    # Input:    "Mr. John Smith     ", 13
    # Output:   "Mr%20John%20Smith"
# Hints: 53, 118

def URLify(input_string, length):
    print(input_string)
    print(length)

    counter = 0  # this is unnecessary but fune
    input_string = input_string.replace(' ', '%20')

    for character in input_string:
        if character == ' ':
            counter += 1
            print(f'space found # {counter}')            

    print(input_string)
    return input_string


example_1 = "Mr. John Smith     "
URLify(example_1, 13)

# 1.3
# URLify
# Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that 
# you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
    # EXAMPLE:
    # Input:    "Mr. John Smith     ", 13
    # Output:   "Mr%20John%20Smith"
# Hints: 53, 118
